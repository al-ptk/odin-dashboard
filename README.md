# odin-dashboard

What I learned with this project:
- Thins can get messy very fast. I want a system that helps to organically organize code in a way that the mess, if needed to exist, at least is contained.
- Naming is hard! I want a naming system \ convention.
- Apparently, a whole lot of programming is about organization. 40% figuring out what to code; 40% figuring out what to name the pieces of code; 20% memeing about being a programmer.
- I've learned grid! More specifically, how to combine both grid-template and grid-auto in a way that the grid behaves a lot like flexbox, where it adds new elements until it wraps a line. I like grid a lot! Even more now, when I understand it better.
